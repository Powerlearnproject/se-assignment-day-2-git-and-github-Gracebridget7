## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Fundamental Concepts of Version Control:

Version control is a system that helps track changes to code, documents, or other digital content over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing different versions of the codebase. The fundamental concepts of version control are:

Repository (Repo): A central location where all versions of the code are stored.
Commit: A snapshot of the code at a particular point in time, which includes changes made since the last commit.
Version: A specific commit or snapshot of the code.
Branch: A separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase, allowing multiple features or fixes to be worked on simultaneously.
Merge: The process of combining changes from one branch into another.
Why GitHub is a Popular Tool for Managing Versions of Code:

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a comprehensive version control system, making it a popular choice among developers. Here's why:

Distributed Version Control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, which allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
